# Introduction


Here is my semester project, a game called "Last straw" more detailed information about the game you can find in GameDocumentation. This is a platformer game with RPG tendencies.

Most of the assets were downloaded from here (there are many free assets on the site): https://craftpix.net/

The music was downloaded from here (I recommend this site because the downloaded music does not have extraneous voices with advertising of the site, as on some others, at least now (September 2024)): https://tunetank.com/music/

Plan of the game (rus): https://mm.tt/app/map/3343608896?t=01dxqlZxNP
